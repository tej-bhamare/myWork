Overview
Many of the times it happens that we get a "Data truncation" error in SQL. This error comes 
when we are crossing the allowed limit for a particular column. For example, the "name" column 
in my table has datatype varchar(10) and I'm trying to insert any name whose length is more than 
10 then SQL will give me data truncation error

Scenario
You are copying data into SQL using copy activty in Azure Data Factory. Your pipeline is running
daily and it failed one day due to data truncation error on the sink (SQL) side. Imagine you have 
20 columns in your table. Unfortunately, the error does not show up which column is having truncation 
issue. In such scenarios, it gets difficult to identify source of error.

Solution
Following dyanmic SQL script allows us to get maximum length of all the columns from our table so that 
we can find which column is exceeding allowed limits 
*/

-- Step 1
-- In the copy activity in ADF, temporarily change the SQL table in the sink to another table. 
-- For example, original table was table1 and we changed it to "aanstelling"
-- Select "Auto create table". This sets all the columns of table to datatype nvarchar(max) 
-- Now run the pipeline to load data into table1_temp

-- Step 2
-- Run following script in SQL to dynamically check max length of each column in aanstelling table
-- This script will not give you direct answer but it will return set of SQL queries in the result
-- You need to copy the result of below script and run the result queries in another tab

select 'select max(len(' + c.name + ')) as '+ c.name +  ' from stg.aanstelling' 
from sys.tables t
join sys.columns c on t.object_id=c.object_id
join sys.schemas s on s.schema_id= t.schema_id
where s.name = 'stg'
and t.name= 'aanstelling'

-- Step 3
-- Result queries will look like following
select max(len(_id)) as _id from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(gebruikersId)) as gebruikersId from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(begindatum)) as begindatum from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(workinghours)) as workinghours from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(TxDate)) as TxDate from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(TxCreatedUtc)) as TxCreatedUtc from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(TenantId)) as TenantId from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(versie_tijdstip)) as versie_tijdstip from stg.aanstelling
select max(len(versie_nummer)) as versie_nummer from stg.aanstelling

-- Running these queries will give you max length of each column from aanstelling table
-- You can compare the allowed column limits from the original table with the result of these queries
-- Quickly you will find which column is crossing the limits and giving an error
-- Don't forget to drop temporary created aanstelling table once error is found
